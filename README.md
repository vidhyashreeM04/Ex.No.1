AI refers to machines performing tasks that require human intelligence.
Machine Learning (ML) helps machines learn from data automatically and improve performance over time.

# 3. What is Generative AI?

Generative AI focuses on generating new content by learning patterns from large datasets.
Key features:
• Produces text, images, music, code
• Learns data distributions
• Outputs often resemble human-generated content

# 4. Types of Generative AI Models

• GANs – Two networks competing to produce realistic outputs
• VAEs – Encode-decode structure to generate new data
• Diffusion Models – Remove noise step-by-step to create images
• Autoregressive Models – Predict next tokens (e.g., GPT models)

# 5. Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are trained on massive datasets and can perform tasks such as summarization, Q&A, translation, reasoning, and content generation.

# 6. Architecture of LLMs

Modern LLMs use the Transformer architecture, which includes:
• Self-Attention
• Multi-Head Attention
• Feedforward networks
• Positional encoding

Examples:
• BERT – Encoder-only
• GPT – Decoder-only

# 7. Training Process and Data Requirements

• Data collection from books, websites, articles
• Tokenization
• Pretraining
• Fine-tuning
• Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

# 8. Use Cases and Applications

• Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
• Content Generation
• Code Generation
• Education
• Healthcare summarization
• Creative tools

# 9. Limitations and Ethical Considerations

• Bias in training data
• Misinformation
• High computation cost
• Privacy concerns
• Ethical misuse (e.g., deepfakes)

# 10. Impact of Scaling in LLMs

Positive Effects:
• Improved accuracy
• Better reasoning
• More fluent output

# Challenges:
• High energy usage
• Expensive training
• Diminishing returns

# 11. Future Trends

• Multimodal AI
• Smaller efficient AI models
